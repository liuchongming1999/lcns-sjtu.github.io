Website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.

## Getting started

For more about how to use Jekyll, check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).

### Installation

Please install Ruby, Bundler and Jekyll with the help of [link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) here on your system.
### Local setup

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repo from `github.com:LCNS-SJTU/lcns-sjtu.github.io` to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, feel free to change the forked repository however you like. After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
